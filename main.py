#  Design, develop, test and evaluate a system that:
# 1. Allows a player to enter their details, which are then authenticated to ensure that they are an
# authorised player.
# 2. Stores a list of song names and artists in an external file.
# 3. Selects a song from the file, displaying the artist and the first letter of each word of the song title.
# 4. Allows the user up to two chances to guess the name of the song, stopping the game if they guess
# a song incorrectly on the second chance.
# 5. If the guess is correct, add the points to the playerâ€™s score depending on the number of guesses.
# 6. Displays the number of points the player has when the game ends.
# 7. Stores the name of the player and their score in an external file.
# 8. Displays the score and player name of the top 5 winning scores from the external file.
